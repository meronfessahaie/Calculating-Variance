# Calculating-Variance Using R
This is code I wrote for geographic data analysis class on how to calculate computational variance and non-computational variance with R.

If you aren't familar with variance or need to refresh on it a bit here is an awesome link for you to do that http://www.miracosta.edu/Home/rmorrissette/Chapter05.htm

Instruction on running the code:
1) Open R. I usually use Rstudio. If you need to download Rstudio here is a link https://www.rstudio.com/
2) Open my file titled calculating_variance.R
3) Once you've opened the file you can use the functions VarCompExpress or VarDefExpress to input your sample numbers.

Note: Make sure you source the contents of the active document. This is located on the right of the Run button.

Ex. VarCompExpress(c(6, 7, 9, 10, 5, 11, 56, 13))
    VarDefExpress(c(6, 7, 9, 10, 5, 11, 56, 13))

ENJOY!!!
